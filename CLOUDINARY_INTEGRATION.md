# Cloudinary Integration for Manga Reader

## Overview

This manga reader application now integrates with Cloudinary to store and retrieve manga data. The system allows you to upload manga covers and store manga metadata in Cloudinary, then fetch and display them on the home page.

## How It Works

### 1. **Manga Upload Process**
- **Cover Images**: Uploaded directly to Cloudinary using the upload preset
- **Manga Data**: Stored locally (localStorage) and backed up to Cloudinary as JSON files
- **Metadata**: Includes title, author, description, genres, rating, views, etc.

### 2. **Data Storage Strategy**
- **Primary Storage**: localStorage for fast access and demo purposes
- **Backup Storage**: Cloudinary as JSON files for persistence
- **Real-world Implementation**: Would use a proper database (MongoDB, PostgreSQL, etc.)

### 3. **Home Page Integration**
- **Featured Manga**: Shows manga with highest ratings
- **Recent Updates**: Shows manga updated in the last 7 days
- **Popular Manga**: Shows manga with most views

3. Create upload preset: `manga_reader`

### Environment Variables (Recommended)
```env
REACT_APP_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
REACT_APP_CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET=your_upload_preset
REACT_APP_CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
REACT_APP_CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
```

## Demo Data

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **401 Unauthorized**: Check Cloudinary credentials and upload preset
2. **No Manga Displayed**: Verify localStorage or Cloudinary data
3. **Upload Failures**: Check file size and format restrictions
4. **Loading Issues**: Check network connectivity and Cloudinary status

### Debug Steps
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify Cloudinary configuration
3. Test upload preset permissions
4. Check localStorage for stored data

## Security Considerations

### Current Implementation
- ✅ Client-side validation
- ✅ File type restrictions
- ✅ File size limits
- ⚠️ Credentials in code (should use environment variables)

### Recommended Security
- 🔒 Environment variables for credentials
- 🔒 Server-side validation
- 🔒 User authentication
- 🔒 Rate limiting
- 🔒 CORS configuration

**Note**: This is a demo implementation. For production use, implement proper security measures and use a real database instead of localStorage.
